# Chest-CT-Reg
Image Registration on Chest CT Volumes

Dataset used - COPDgene (Castillo, Richard et al. “A reference dataset for deformable image registration spatial accuracy evaluation using the COPDgene study archive.” Physics in medicine and biology vol. 58,9 (2013): 2861-77. doi:10.1088/0031-9155/58/9/2861)

How to play with the codes?

1. Follow the steps for the Classical Registration Pipeline Step-Wise. There are a few details to take care of in the dataset.
2. Use the DICOM Files to train the Voxelmoprh Deep Learning Pipeline, and obtain the result and calculate the TRE in both the aforementioned pipelines.
